# Drinal Avatar Curse ACT Plugin
This plugin helps healers cure the *Power Over Death* curse that the Drinal avatar casts on raiders.

The mechanic of the curse is that when cured, Drinal recasts it on a player about one second later. So if it is immediately cured, the raid will quickly run out of curse cures.

The mechanic of the cure is that the curse needs to sit on a player for a while before it is cured, to allow the cooldown time on healer curse cures to expire.

This plugin starts a timer when the curse lands on a player. At the expiration of the timer, the plugin generates an audio alert that says *cure name*, where *name* is the player to cure.

The plugin also watches for the curse to be cured to prepare for the next curse to land.

The sequence of events is:
1. Curse lands on Player1
1. Plugin timer starts.
1. Plugin timer expires.
1. Plugin announces "cure Player1"
1. Healer cures Player1
1. Drinal casts the curse on Player2
1. Plugin timer starts.
1. Repeat from Step 3.

The default values for the curse landing, being cured, alert time, and alert text are set for the Drinal avatar and shown below. The "let the curse sit" time defaults to 17 seconds. This (barely) allows three healers to cover the curses with a little bit of margin for error. Four healers is safer.
